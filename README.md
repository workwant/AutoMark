### A windows app that allows you to annotate images using color codes, custom text or measurements. However, some issues still need to be worked out, as the program is rather difficult to use in its current state
# How to use
### Import your photos and annotate them in seconds
Whenever you want to edit an image file, you can either load it from the clipboard or navigate to its location on your hard drive.

The application is then launched in full-screen mode, and you can add color code annotations with only two mouse clicks. Leader lines are created automatically, and you can also position the text boxes manually.

Additionally, it is possible to add labels that use custom text, as well as insert measurements.

### Personalize your annotations and export the edited images
You can change the color of the leader lines and labels, and the text box backgrounds can also be made transparent.

Moreover, the color codes can be displayed in the standard RGB or the web color format, and you can also copy these values to the clipboard.

The modified photos can be exported to PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIFF or TIFF files.
